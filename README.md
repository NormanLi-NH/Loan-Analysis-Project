# Loan Analysis and Visualization

## Overview

This project provides tools for analyzing loan data, visualizing trends, and predicting interest rates using Python. It includes various functions for:

- **Loan Amount to Annual Income Ratio**: Calculate and analyze the ratio of loan amounts to annual income.
- **Annual Installment to Annual Income**: Assess the proportion of annual installments relative to annual income.
- **Total Interest Analysis**: Analyze the total interest paid over the loan term.
- **Loan Purpose Count**: Visualize the distribution of loan purposes.
- **Count by State**: Display the number of loans issued by state.
- **Mean Interest Rate by Grade**: Show average interest rates categorized by loan grade.
- **Mean Interest Rate by Home Ownership**: Analyze average interest rates based on home ownership status.
- **Interest Rate Distribution by Loan Term**: Visualize interest rates based on the term of the loan.
- **Interest Rates Over Time**: Plot mean interest rates over time alongside FED interest rates.
- **Normalized Interest Rates Over Time**: Normalize and compare loan and FED interest rates over time.

The project also includes a user-friendly GUI for easy interaction and data analysis.

## Requirements

To run this project, you need the following:

- **Python 3.x**
- **Pandas**
- **Matplotlib**
- **Seaborn**
- **Scikit-learn**
- **Tkinter** (included with standard Python installations)

You can install the required libraries using pip:

```bash
pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn

Data
This project requires a dataset containing loan information. Make sure your dataset includes the following columns:

annual_inc: Annual income of the borrower.
avg_cur_bal: Average current balance.
grade: Loan grade (A-G).
state: Borrowerâ€™s state.
purpose: Purpose of the loan (e.g., home improvement, debt consolidation).
int_rate: Interest rate of the loan.
issue_date: Date the loan was issued.

Usage
To get started, follow these steps:

Clone the repository:
bash


git clone <repository-url>
cd loan-analysis
Load your dataset into the inner_join_df DataFrame.
Run the script:
bash


python loan_analysis.py
Use the GUI to:
Input borrower information for interest rate calculations.
Select various plots to visualize loan data.

Functions
Data Visualization Functions
plot_loan_purpose(): Visualizes the distribution of loan purposes using a pie chart.
plot_state_counts(): Displays a bar chart of loan counts by state.
plot_grade_analysis(): Shows the mean interest rates categorized by loan grade.
plot_home_ownership_analysis(): Analyzes mean interest rates based on home ownership status.
plot_term_analysis(): Visualizes the distribution of interest rates by loan term.
plot_interest_rate_over_time(): Plots mean interest rates over time alongside FED interest rates.
plot_normalised_interest_rate_over_time(): Normalizes and compares loan and FED interest rates over time.

Machine Learning
This project includes a linear regression model that predicts interest rates based on annual_inc, avg_cur_bal, and grade_score.

GUI Functions
A Tkinter-based GUI allows users to input their financial data and generate visualizations easily.
